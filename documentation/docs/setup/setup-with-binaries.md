# Testnet Node Setup
Tools to join the axelar network using binaries for mac/linux.

This tutorial will take 30-60 minutes of dev time and 2-4 hours of waiting for blockchain sync. The tutorial includes steps for joining the axelar network using two ways. A docker based setup and a setup using binaries. As per your preference, follow the steps for one of the two options.

## Disclaimer
!> :fire: Axelar Network is a work in progress. At no point in time should you transfer any real assets using Axelar. Only use testnet tokens that you're not afraid to lose. Axelar is not responsible for any assets lost, frozen, or unrecoverable in any state or condition. If you find a problem, please submit an issue to this repository following the template.


## Prerequisites

- Mac OS or Ubuntu (tested on 18.04)
- Architectures Supported are arm64 and amd64
- JQ command line tool (`apt-get install jq` on Ubuntu, `brew install jq` on Mac OS)
- Minimum hardware requirements: 4 cores, 8-16GB RAM, 512 GB drive. Recommended 6-8 cores, 16-32 GB RAM, 1 TB+ drive.

## Useful links

- Latest docker images:
  + https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/axelarnet/axelar-core
  + https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/axelarnet/tofnd

## Useful commands


Axelar will run upto three unique processes. axelar-core, vald and tofnd. If you are not running a validator, a single process for axelar-core is run. To kill these processes

For axelar-core
```bash
kill -9 $(pgrep -f 'axelard start')
```

For vald
```bash
kill -9 $(pgrep -f 'axelard vald-start')
```

For tofnd
```bash
kill -9 $(pgrep tofnd)
```

## Joining the Axelar testnet

Clone the repository to use the scripts and configs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community.git
cd axelarate-community
```

Checkout the correct tag so the scripts work with the deployment. Find the right tag [here](/resources/testnet-releases.md).
```bash
git checkout <release-tag>
```


Determine your public IP address. [This Website can help](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). Change the `external_address` field in the `join/config.toml` file and append the rpc port.
```bash
external_address = "123.123.123.123:26656"
```

You should have port forwarding setup with your router. We recommend forwarding ports 1317, 26656-26658 and 26660.

Run the script `./join/join-testnet-with-binaries.sh`
```log
Usage: join-testnet-with-binaries.sh [flags]

Optional flags:
-r, --root           Local directory to store testnet data in (IMPORTANT: this directory is removed and recreated if --reset-chain is set)
--bin-directory      Local directory where the downloaded binaries are stored. Defaults to <root_directory>/bin
--axelar-core       Version of axelar-core docker image to run (Format: vX.Y.Z) (by default latest versions are used)
--tendermint-key     Path to the tendermint private key file. Used for recovering a node.
--validator-mnemonic Path to the Axelar validator key. Used for recovering a node.
--reset-chain        Delete local data to do a clean connect to the testnet (If you participated in an older version of the testnet)
```

After running `./join/join-testnet-with-binaries.sh`, you should see the following output:

```yaml
Axelar node running.

Validator address: axelarvaloper1ttxxytlz377agnvzqhllzxmg7dd76tnrwzyahz


- name: validator
  type: local
  address: axelar1ttxxytlz377agnvzqhllzxmg7dd76tnrwrjc9d
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A+O6nUmpQs1meQLtr2RaG5DExv1nyU9cQJKeAUJNH828"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

naive segment sword error champion pyramid world spend tool reason sound hub barrel amazing parade ahead lamp flag disorder sunny loop artist almost expire

Do not forget to also backup the tendermint key (/Users/talalashraf/.axelar_testnet/.core/config/priv_validator_key.json)

To follow execution, run 'tail -f /Users/talalashraf/.axelar_testnet/logs/axelard.log'
To stop the node, run 'killall -9 "axelard"'
```

 Wait for your node to catch up with the network before proceeding.
 Use `tail -f $HOME/axelar_testnet/logs/axelard.log` to keep an eye on the node's progress (this can take a while). Your logs will be in `ROOT_DIRECTORY/logs` where `ROOT_DIRECTORY` is whatever you passed through the flag.

 You can check the sync status by running:
 ```bash
curl localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.sync_info'
```

**Output:**
 ```json
{
  "latest_block_hash": "0B64D2A0EDAB6CEF229510E52F137130134D94AAD64EACB553D51D01B0D1A446",

  "earliest_block_time": "2021-05-31T21:05:12.032466392Z",
  "catching_up": true
}
```
Wait for `catching_up` to become `false`

## Ethereum account on testnet
Axelar signs meta transactions for Ethereum, meaning that any Ethereum account can send transaction executing commands so long as the commands are signed by Axelar's key. In the exercises, all of the Ethereum-related transactions are sent from address `0xE3deF8C6b7E357bf38eC701Ce631f78F2532987A` on Ropsten testnet.

## Generate a key on Axelar and get test tokens

You can add `$HOME/.axelar_testnet/bin` to your path. The bin directory will be different depending on your root directory. Alternatively you can use the full path to run the executable as mentioned in the instructions. Set the `AXELARD_CHAIN_ID` environment variable to `axelar-testnet-toronto`, you can run `export AXELARD_CHAIN_ID=axelar-testnet-toronto`.

1. By default, the node has an account named validator. Find its address:
```bash
$HOME/.axelar_testnet/bin/axelard keys show validator -a --home ~/.axelar_testnet/.core
```
2. Go to axelar faucet and get some coins on your validator's address (Your node is not yet a validator for the purpose of this ceremony; it's just the name of the account). http://faucet.testnet.axelar.dev/

3. Check that you received the funds
```bash
$HOME/.axelar_testnet/bin/axelard q bank balances {output_addr_from_step_2} --home ~/.axelar_testnet/.core
```
e.g:
```bash
$HOME/.axelar_testnet/bin/axelard q bank balances axelar1hk3xagjvl4ee8lpdd736h6wcwsudrv0f5ya2we --home ~/.axelar_testnet/.core
```
 ?> :bulb: Balance will appear only after you are fully synced with the network

## Stop and restart testnet

To stop the node, open a new CLI terminal and run
```bash
killall axelard
```

To restart the node, run the `./join/join-testnet-with-binaries.sh` script again, with the same flags as you ran it the first time. Do NOT use the `--reset-chain` flag or your node will have to sync again from the beginning (and if you haven't backed up your keys, they will be lost).
