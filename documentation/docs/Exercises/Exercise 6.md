## Disclaimer
:::warning
Axelar Network is a work in progress. At no point in time should you transfer any real assets using Axelar. Only use testnet tokens that you're not afraid to lose. Axelar is not responsible for any assets lost, frozen, or unrecoverable in any state or condition. If you find a problem, please submit an issue to this repository following the template.

## Prerequisites
- Complete all steps from [Setup with Docker](/setup-docker) or [Setup with Binaries](/setup-binaries)
- Have a Ethereum wallet setup and have an Ethereum address funded with some Ether (You can also choose to use the [Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mew-cx/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm?hl=en))
- You must have enough AXL tokens in your Axelar Network address to stake at least 1AXL and pay for transaction gas fees. You can get AXL tokens from the [Axelar faucet](http://faucet.testnet.axelar.dev/).
