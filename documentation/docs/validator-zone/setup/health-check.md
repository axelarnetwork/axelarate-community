# Health check
-----

Check the status of your validator.

* tofnd check: `tofnd` companion process is alive and accessible from `vald`.
* broadcaster: Your `broadcaster` address is registered and adequately funded.
* operator check: Your operator address is indeed an Axelar validator in good status. (Possible bad status includes: missed too many blocks, jail status, etc.)

This step is not mandatory but it is good practice to help you detect and diagnose problems with your validator.

In the `vald` container:

```bash
axelard health-check --tofnd-host TOFND_HOST_NAME --operator-addr YOUR_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS --node AXELAR_CORE_HOST_NAME
```

For example

```bash
axelard health-check --tofnd-host tofnd --operator-addr $(cat /root/shared/validator.bech) --node http://axelar-core:26657
```

You should see output like:

```yaml
tofnd check: passed
broadcaster check: passed
operator check: passed
```


>Your validator node automatically posts a `heartbeat` transaction to the Axelar network every 50 blocks.
>If you do `axelard health-check` within 50 blocks after first becoming a validator then your validator will not yet post a `heartbeat` transaction.
>
>If you see a failure:
>
> ```yaml
>tofnd check: passed
>broadcaster check: passed
>operator check: failed (health check to operator axelarvaloper108609p4dsau577ggh6g4mfu0cgtd4vw5t2xzfk failed due to the following issues: {"stale_tss_heartbeat":true})
>```
> 
>then check the error to understand the mitigation needed. The vald/tofnd logs should help in debugging the problem.
>A stale tss heartbeat status suggests that your vald/tofnd might not be alive/responsive.
>A proxy insufficient funds status suggests that your broadcaster address has less than 5 AXL and needs to be funded.
>An operator not found among the current set of validators status suggests that your validator might be jailed or unbonding.
>
>After resolving the issue, wait for 50 blocks and perform a health check again.
