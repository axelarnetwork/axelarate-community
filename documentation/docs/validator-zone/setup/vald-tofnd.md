# Launch companion processes for the first time
-----------

Axelar validators need two companion processes called `vald` and `tofnd`.
Launch these processes for the first time by running, if using Docker, `./join/launch-validator-tools.sh`,
or if using binaries `./join/launch-validator-tools-with-binaries.sh`.  The output should be something like:

```yaml
Tofnd & Vald running.

Proxy address: axelar1xg93jnefgz3gsnuyqrmq2q288z8st3cf43jecs

To become a validator get some uaxl tokens from the faucet and stake them

Do not forget to also backup the tofnd mnemonic (/Users/talalashraf/.tofnd/import)

To follow tofnd execution, run 'docker logs -f tofnd'
To follow vald execution, run 'docker logs -f vald'
To stop tofnd, run 'docker stop tofnd'
To stop vald, run 'docker stop vald'
```

Save a copy of your `broadcaster` mnemonic in a safe place.  See [Backup](/validator-zone/setup/backup) for detailed instructions.
