# Testnet Node Setup
Tools to join the axelar network

This tutorial will take 30-60 minutes of dev time and 2-4 hours of waiting for blockchain sync.

## Disclaimer
:::warning
Axelar Network is a work in progress. At no point in time should you transfer any real assets using Axelar. Only use testnet tokens that you're not afraid to lose. Axelar is not responsible for any assets lost, frozen, or unrecoverable in any state or condition. If you find a problem, please submit an issue to this repository following the template.
:::

## Prerequisites

- Mac OS or Ubuntu (tested on 18.04)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Minimum hardware requirements: 4 cores, 8-16GB RAM, 512 GB drive. Recommended 6-8 cores, 16-32 GB RAM, 1 TB+ drive.


## Useful links
- [Axelar faucet](http://faucet.testnet.axelar.network/)
- Latest docker images:
  + https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/axelarnet/axelar-core
  + https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/axelarnet/tofnd

## Useful commands
Axelar node runs in two containers (one with the core consensus engine and another with threshold crypto process). You can stop/remove all your containers using:
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
If you did not add the `docker` user to the `sudo` group, you will have to prepend `sudo` to the previous commands.


If you see an error related to insufficient gas at any point during the workflow, add the flags
```bash
--gas=auto --gas-adjustment 1.2
```

## Joining the Axelar testnet

Clone the repository to use the script and configs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community.git
cd axelarate-community
```

Run the script `join/joinTestnet.sh`
```bash
Usage: joinTestnet.sh [flags]

Mandatory flags:

--axelar-core       Version of axelar-core docker image to run (Format: vX.Y.Z)
--tofnd             Version of tofnd docker image to run (Format: vX.Y.Z)

Optional flags:
-r, --root          Local directory to store testnet data in (IMPORTANT: this directory is removed and recreated if --reset-chain is set)

--reset-chain       Delete local data to do a clean connect to the testnet (If you participated in an older version of the testnet)

```
See [Testnet Release](/testnet-releases) for the latest available versions of the docker images.

You can get the latest version and save it to variables:
```bash
TOFND_VERSION=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community/main/TESTNET%20RELEASE.md | grep tofnd | cut -d \` -f 4)
CORE_VERSION=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community/main/TESTNET%20RELEASE.md | grep axelar-core | cut -d \` -f 4)
echo ${TOFND_VERSION} ${CORE_VERSION}
```

Once you join, at the terminal you should see blocks produced quickly.

```
 Wait for your node to catch up with the network before proceeding. This can take a while. 
 You can check the sync status by running:
 ```bash
curl localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.sync_info'
```
Note: Install `jq` for json processing, on Ubuntu you can install it by running:
```bash
 sudo apt-get install jq
```

**Output:**
 ```json

  "latest_block_hash": "0B64D2A0EDAB6CEF229510E52F137130134D94AAD64EACB553D51D01B0D1A446",

  "catching_up": true
}
```
Wait for `catching_up` to become `false`

## Logging to file
By default, logs output to stdout and stderr. You could redirect logs to a file for debugging and error reporting:
```bash
join/joinTestnet.sh --axelar-core ${CORE_VERSION} --tofnd ${TOFND_VERSION} &>> testnet.log
```
On a new terminal window, you could monitor the log file in real time:
```bash
tail -f testnet.log
```
If you find the log containing too much noise and hard to find useful information, you can filter it as following
```bash
docker logs -f axelar-core 2>&1 | grep -a -e threshold -e num_txs -e proxies
```

## Ethereum account on testnet
Axelar signs meta transactions for Ethereum, meaning that any Ethereum account can send transaction executing commands so long as the commands are signed by Axelar's key. In the exercises, all of the Ethereum-related transactions are sent from address `0xE3deF8C6b7E357bf38eC701Ce631f78F2532987A` on Ropsten testnet.

## Generate a key on Axelar and get test tokens
1. On a new terminal window, enter Axelar node:
```bash
docker exec -it axelar-core sh
```
2. By default, the node has an account named validator. Find its address:
```bash
axelard keys show validator -a
```
3. Go to axelar faucet and get some coins on your validator's address (Your node is not yet a validator for the purpose of this ceremony; it's just the name of the account). http://faucet.testnet.axelar.network/

4. Check that you received the funds
```bash
axelard q bank balances {output_addr_from_step_2}
```
e.g.
```bash
axelard q bank balances axelar1p5nl00z6h5fuzyzfylhf8w7g3qj6lmlyryqmhg
```
:::tip
Balance will appear only after you are fully synced with the network
:::

## Stop and restart testnet
To leave the Axelar node CLI, type `exit`.
To stop the node from syncing, press Control C, then 
	To stop the node, open a new CLI terminal and run	
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)	
```	
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)	
```

To restart the node, run the `join/joinTestnet.sh` script again, with the same `--axelar-core`, `--tofnd` (and optionally `--root`) parameters as before. Do NOT use the `--reset-chain` flag or your node will have to sync again from the beginning.
	
To enter Axelar node CLI again
```bash
docker exec -it axelar-core sh
```
