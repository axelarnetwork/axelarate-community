### Overview

This document describes the steps necessary to ensure that a validator node can backup keys in order to be able to recover their state in the future. The following data is needed to be backed up safely:

* Tendermint validator key
* Axelar validator mnemonic
* Axelar proxy mnemonic
* Tofnd mnemonic

For recover instructions, please see [recover](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community/blob/main/documentation/Admin/validator-recovery.md).

### Tendermint validator key

The Tendermint validator key is created when a node is launched for the first time.
It can be found within the node's container at `c` (or on the host at `$HOME/.axelar_testnet/.core/config/priv_validator_key.json`).

#### Key backup

The content of the `priv_validator_key` file should look something like:

```bash
{
  "address": "98AF6E5D52BBB62BE6717DE8C55F16F5C013D7BE",
  "pub_key": {
    "type": "tendermint/PubKeyEd25519",
    "value": "CcspC1QDG8vz7kIW/7nPvqQ35XFJ5JLn5+li2WshP+o="
  },
  "priv_key": {
    "type": "tendermint/PrivKeyEd25519",
    "value": "VCG8TTeOSv+n9TOyy465CnUQALnoD/WJG9bloPGX0XUJyykLVAMby/PuQhb/uc++pDflcUnkkufn6WLZayE/6g=="
  }
}
```

**Attention:** Be sure to store the content of this file at a safe, offline place.

### Axelar mnemonics

The Axelar mnemonics are created when an node/validator is launched for the first time and subsequently outputed to the terminal.
The output looks something like:

```bash
**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

#### Mnemonic backup

There should be one mnemonic for the Axelar validator key and another for the Axelar proxy key.
The former should be displayed after running `join/join-testnet.sh` with a clean slate, while the latter should be displayed by `join/launch-validator.sh`.

**Attention:** Be sure to store this mnemonic at a safe, offline place.

### Tofnd mnemonic

Tofnd needs to be provided with a mnemonic the first time it operates. From this mnemonic, a private key is derived and stored in tofnd's internal database. The private key is used to encrypt and decrypt the recovery information of the user.

By default, a mnemonic is created when tofnd is launched for the first time. Users can use this mnenonic to recover their information in case of data loss. Once a private key is created and stored at tofnd's internal database, the mnemonic file is no longer needed.

If you are running tofnd in a **containerized environment**, the mnemonic can be found within the tofnd container at `/.tofnd/export`, or on the mounted volume on the host machine at `$HOME/.axelar_testnet/.tofnd/export`.

If you are running tofnd as a **binary**, the mnemonic can be found under the directory from which you ran the executable, at `$TOFND_PATH/.tofnd/export`.

The mnemonic file should look something like:
```bash
purchase arrow sword basic gasp category hundred town layer snow mother roast digital fragile repeat monitor wrong combine awful nature damage rib skull chalk
```

**Attention:** Be sure to store your mnemonic at a safe, offline place. After storing it, be sure it is deleted from tofnd's container or tofnd's host machine.
