# Master/Secondary Key Rotation
In order to rotate to a new key, you basically need to trigger a consolidation transaction sending the change amount to a master/secondary key that is different than the current one. Check the steps at [Bitcoin Consolidation Transaction](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarate-community/blob/main/documentation/Admin/btc-consolidation-transaction.md), and make sure to use a different master/secondary key ID at step 1.
